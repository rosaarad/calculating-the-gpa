The input contains an unknown number of lines until the exit is entered. 
Each line comes in the form of two numbers with a space, the first number (number on the left) represents the grade of the course and the next number represents the number of units of that course.
In the only output line of your program, the weighted average of grades should be printed to one decimal place.
